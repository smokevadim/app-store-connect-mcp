 * session reproduced this text verbatim, and a build with the field blanked
 * answered "NONE RECEIVED".
 *
 * Every line states a fact about the API. None gives advice about how to
 * behave, and that distinction was expensive to learn. Two advice lines shipped
 * here first — do not search the local disk, take an empty result as the answer
 * — and an A/B against a build without them could not measure any effect: three
 * samples per condition, and the spread within one condition (374k to 1341k
 * tokens on the same task) swamped every difference between conditions. What
 * the runs did show was the agent shelling out to `jq` in all nine of them,
 * under every instruction set, because one response in that task is 264 KB. No
 * sentence fixes a response that does not fit; only a smaller response does.
 *
 * So the bar is: a line belongs here if the model would get it wrong from the
 * schemas alone, and if knowing it changes the call rather than the attitude.
 * Anything a parameter description can carry belongs there instead — those are
 * generated, so `filter[territory]` states its own format on every one of the
 * 23 operations that take it, and this line is the backstop for clients that
