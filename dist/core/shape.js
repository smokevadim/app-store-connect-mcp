/**
 * Response shaping for App Store Connect payloads.
 *
 * Measured on a real price-point listing: each item was ~1,100 bytes of which
 * ~120 bytes were data — the rest was `links` and links-only `relationships`
 * blocks repeating the same base64 id in URL form five times. The model never
 * follows those URLs (pagination rides on the separate `next_url` parameter),
 * so they are stripped by default, cutting a 900 KB listing to roughly 100 KB.
 * Set ASC_KEEP_RAW_RESPONSES=1 to pass Apple's payloads through untouched.
 *
 * On top of that, a configurable character ceiling keeps a single response
 * from flooding the client's context: oversized `data` arrays are cut to the
 * items that fit and the response says so, instead of silently costing tens of
 * thousands of tokens.
