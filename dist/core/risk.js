/**
 * Risk manifest for mutating operations.
 *
 * `readOnly: method === 'get'` says whether an operation CAN change something,
 * but not what a change costs: a price PATCH and adding a beta tester are both
 * "mutating", yet one moves revenue in every storefront and the other is a
 * low-stakes, reversible edit. The confirmation prompt (and --dry-run output)
 * shows this level, and the high-stakes levels require typed confirmation.
 *
 * This file is the hand-reviewed source of truth: the generator stamps each
 * mutating operation with `risk` from these rules, so a spec update makes new
 * operations' classifications reviewable in the generated diff. RULES are
 * ordered — the first match wins — and run on the dotted operation name.
 *
 * Levels:
 *  - low            reversible, limited blast radius (TestFlight, webhooks, GC config)
 *  - public         changes what customers see on the store (metadata, screenshots, replies)
 *  - release        moves a version toward or through release (submissions, phased release)
 *  - revenue        touches money (prices, subscriptions, IAPs, offers)
 *  - destructive    deletes a resource
 *  - infrastructure code signing / CI (certificates, profiles, workflows)
 *  - access         who can do what (users, invitations, sandbox testers)
