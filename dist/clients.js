/**
 * The MCP clients setup can register profiles with.
 *
 * Every client speaks the same protocol and none of them share a config file,
 * so the only thing that travels between them is a command and its arguments.
 * Everything else — the path, the file format, the key the servers hang off —
 * is per client, and getting one wrong is silent: the server never starts and
 * the client says nothing.
 *
 * Each client is a list of targets rather than a single file, because two
 * products can share a name. "Claude" is Claude Code plus Claude Desktop, and a
 * machine may have either or both.
 *
 * Paths and key names below were read from each vendor's own documentation in
 * August 2026, not inferred. The three that surprise:
 *   - VS Code's key is `servers`, not `mcpServers`.
 *   - Codex is TOML, but its CLI writes it, so nothing here generates TOML.
 *   - ChatGPT desktop, Codex CLI and the Codex IDE extension share one file.
