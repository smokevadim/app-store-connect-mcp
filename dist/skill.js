/**
 * Installs the `heimdall` skill alongside the MCP server registration.
 *
 * The skill exists because of a gap nothing in the server can close: before it
 * is registered there is no server, so the one thing an agent most needs to
 * know first — that the API key is minted inside the process and cannot be
 * found in a shell, and that `setup` belongs to the user — has no channel. A
 * checkout would carry AGENTS.md, but Heimdall runs through `npx` and there is
 * no checkout.
 *
 * So `register` writes the document to disk next to the config it is already
 * writing. No new mechanism, no separate install step, and the same command
 * removes it.
 *
 * Only for clients that actually read SKILL.md. Writing it into a Cursor or
 * VS Code config directory would leave a file nothing loads, and a file nothing
 * loads is worse than no file: it looks like the feature is present.
