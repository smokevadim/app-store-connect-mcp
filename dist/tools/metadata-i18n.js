/**
 * Store metadata across languages — audited, drafted, and applied from a file
 * the user wrote.
 *
 * The shape of these three tools comes from one fact about App Store metadata:
 * the keyword field is a ranking input, not prose. The right Turkish keywords
 * are not a translation of the right English ones; they are the words Turkish
 * users actually type into search. A tool that renders English keywords into
 * Turkish and writes them has quietly replaced a ranking decision with a
 * language exercise, and nobody finds out until the installs do not arrive.
 *
 * So nothing here writes on its own judgement:
 *
 *   audit    reports gaps and stops. A finding is not a licence to fix it.
 *   draft    runs only when the caller named the target locales, and returns
 *            text for a person to read. It never writes.
 *   apply    writes values the user already decided, read from their file.
 *            The model does not retype them — transcription is exactly where
 *            a carefully chosen keyword list turns into a nearly-identical one.
 *
 * The audit and the draft use the same data+instruction pattern as
 * `./reviews-ai.ts`: Heimdall fetches and packages, the host model writes the
 * words. No second API key, and nothing goes to a model the user did not
 * already choose.
