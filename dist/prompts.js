/**
 * The workflows a person asks for by name, not the tools they are built from.
 *
 * A prompt is not a second way to describe a tool — the tool descriptions do
 * that, and duplicating them here would be prose competing with prose. What a
 * prompt carries is the *order*: which of 883 tools to call first, what to do
 * with the answer, and when to stop. "Can I ship this?" is four calls whose
 * sequence matters and whose combination has no tool of its own, and a model
 * that has to invent that sequence invents a different one each time.
 *
 * Two rules keep this list from growing into a menu nobody reads:
 *
 *   1. A prompt earns its place only if it chains calls. A prompt that wraps
 *      one tool is that tool with a longer name.
 *   2. A prompt is only offered when every tool it names is actually served.
 *      Profile mode means most servers carry a slice, and a workflow that
 *      references a tool this server does not have is worse than no workflow:
 *      it reads as a capability and fails at the first step.
