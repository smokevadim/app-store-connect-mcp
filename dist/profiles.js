/**
 * A profile is one purpose-built MCP server carved out of the full spec: a

 * any profile — `asc-mcp monetization` — so one install backs seventeen
 * differently-scoped servers and a client config picks per project.
 *
 * Membership is hand-curated in `spec/profiles.csv` and generated into
 * `src/generated/profiles-data.ts`. It used to be derived from the URL, which
 * put every app relationship (`/v1/apps/{id}/subscriptionGroups`) in the
 * app-info profile while the resource itself lived elsewhere — so eight of
 * eleven profiles could not reach their own resources from an app.
